Certainly! Here's an example of how you can create a scene in Unity with a cube, plane, and sphere, and apply transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) to these objects using C#.

Step 1: Setting up the Scene
1. Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
2. In the Hierarchy window, right-click and select "3D Object" > "Cube" to create a cube.
3. Similarly, create a sphere by right-clicking and selecting "3D Object" > "Sphere".
4. To create a plane, go to "GameObject" > "3D Object" > "Plane".

Step 2: Apply Transformations using C#
1. Create a new C# script by right-clicking in the Project window and selecting "Create" > "C# Script". Name it something like "ObjectTransformations".
2. Double-click the script to open it in your preferred code editor.
3. Inside the script, add the following code:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectTransformations : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject cube;
    public GameObject sphere;
    public GameObject plane;

    void Start()
    {
        // Apply translation to the cube
        cube.transform.Translate(new Vector3(2f, 0f, 0f));

        // Apply rotation to the sphere
        sphere.transform.Rotate(new Vector3(0f, 45f, 0f));

        // Apply scaling to the plane
        plane.transform.localScale = new Vector3(2f, 1f, 2f);
    }
}
```

4. Save the script and go back to the Unity editor.
5. Attach the "ObjectTransformations" script to any GameObject in the scene.
6. In the Inspector window for the attached script, drag and drop the cube, sphere, and plane GameObjects into their respective slots.

Step 3: Play the Scene
1. Save your scene by going to "File" > "Save Scene" and choose a name for your scene file.
2. Click the Play button at the top of the Unity editor to run the scene.
3. The cube will be translated by 2 units on the X-axis, the sphere will rotate by 45 degrees around the Y-axis, and the plane will scale to twice its original size.

By using the C# script, you can easily modify and apply various transformations to the cube, sphere, and plane objects. You can experiment with different values and combinations to achieve the desired visual effects.
