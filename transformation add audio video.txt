Certainly! Here's an example of how you can create a scene in Unity with a cube, plane, and sphere, apply transformations to these objects, and add a video and audio source.

Step 1: Setting up the Scene
1. Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
2. In the Hierarchy window, right-click and select "3D Object" > "Cube" to create a cube.
3. Similarly, create a sphere by right-clicking and selecting "3D Object" > "Sphere".
4. To create a plane, go to "GameObject" > "3D Object" > "Plane".

Step 2: Apply Transformations
1. Select the cube in the Hierarchy window.
2. In the Inspector window, under the Transform component, you'll see Position, Rotation, and Scale properties.
3. Adjust the values of these properties to apply the desired transformations to the cube. For example, you can change the Position to move the cube to a different location, Rotation to rotate it, and Scale to resize it.
4. Repeat the same process for the sphere and plane, applying different transformations as per your requirements.

Step 3: Adding Video and Audio Sources
1. To add a video source, you'll need to import a video file into your Unity project. Go to the "Project" window, right-click, and select "Import New Asset". Choose a video file from your computer.
2. Once the video is imported, create a new GameObject by right-clicking in the Hierarchy window and selecting "Create Empty".
3. With the new GameObject selected, go to the Inspector window and click on "Add Component". Search for "Video Player" and click on it to add the Video Player component.
4. In the Video Player component, you'll see a Video Clip property. Drag and drop the imported video file into this property.
5. Adjust other properties like Play on Awake, Looping, and Render Mode as per your requirements.

To add an audio source:
1. Create another new GameObject in the Hierarchy window by right-clicking and selecting "Create Empty".
2. Select the new GameObject and go to the Inspector window.
3. Click on "Add Component" and search for "Audio Source". Add the Audio Source component.
4. You can import an audio file into your Unity project similarly to how you imported the video file.
5. Drag and drop the imported audio file into the AudioClip property of the Audio Source component.
6. Adjust other properties like Play on Awake, Loop, and Volume as per your requirements.

Step 4: Play the Scene
1. Save your scene by going to "File" > "Save Scene" and choose a name for your scene file.
2. Click the Play button at the top of the Unity editor to run the scene.
3. You should now see your cube, sphere, and plane with the applied transformations. The video and audio sources should also be playing as per their settings.

That's it! You have now created a scene in Unity with a cube, sphere, and plane, applied transformations to the objects, and added a video and audio source. You can further customize the scene by adding lights, materials, and other effects to enhance the visual and auditory experience.
