To create a rolling ball scene in Unity, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the Scene
1. Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
2. In the Hierarchy window, right-click and select "3D Object" > "Plane" to create a ground plane.
3. Create a sphere by right-clicking and selecting "3D Object" > "Sphere". This will be your rolling ball.

Step 2: Add Physics Components
1. Select the sphere in the Hierarchy window.
2. In the Inspector window, click on "Add Component" and search for "Rigidbody". Add the Rigidbody component to the sphere.
3. Enable the "Use Gravity" checkbox in the Rigidbody component to allow the ball to fall with gravity.

Step 3: Create Movement Script
1. Create a new C# script by right-clicking in the Project window and selecting "Create" > "C# Script". Name it something like "BallMovement".
2. Double-click the script to open it in your preferred code editor.
3. Inside the script, add the following code:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BallMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 5f;  // Speed of the ball

    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0f, moveVertical);
        rb.AddForce(movement * speed);
    }
}
```

4. Save the script and go back to the Unity editor.
5. Attach the "BallMovement" script to the ball GameObject.

Step 4: Play the Scene
1. Save your scene by going to "File" > "Save Scene" and choose a name for your scene file.
2. Click the Play button at the top of the Unity editor to run the scene.
3. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the ball and make it roll on the ground plane.

Now, when you play the scene, the ball will roll on the ground plane based on the player's input. You can adjust the speed variable in the script to change the movement speed of the ball. Additionally, you can further enhance the scene by adding obstacles, collectibles, or other features to make the rolling ball experience more engaging and interactive.
